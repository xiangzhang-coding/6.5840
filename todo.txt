just one coordinator process

Each worker process will, in a loop,
ask the coordinator for a task,
read the task's input from one or more files, 
execute the task, 
write the task's output to one or more files,
and again ask the coordinator for a new task. 

The coordinator should notice if a worker 
hasn't completed its task in a reasonable amount of time
(for this lab, use ten seconds), 
and give the same task to a different worker.
